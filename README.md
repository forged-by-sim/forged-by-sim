# 👩🏽‍🔬 forged-by-sim

🧪 Crafting immersive, science-rooted simulations with code, curiosity, and a growth-like mindset.

Welcome to my portfolio! I come from 7 years of medical simulation operations, where I worked hands-on with high-fidelity manikins (Laerdal, Gaumard, Big Red), ran classroom simulations, instructed students, and troubleshot hardware/software in fast-paced environments.

With a scientific background in biological and biomedical sciences, I am now transitioning into technical simulation development. Over the past year, I’ve been aggressively upskilling in:

XR development (Unity, Blender, A-Frame/WebXR)

Programming (C/C++, Python, MATLAB)

SQL & database design

Version control (Git & GitHub)

3D modeling + rigging

Web-based VR/AR pipeline design

I’m self-taught and have been building a technical foundation through Coursera, hands-on projects, and simulation-focused tutorials.

🔧 Technical Projects

🦕 XR Dinosaur Project (Unity + A-Frame WebXR)

Rigging, animation, VR/AR scene design, WebXR deployment, and extensive Unity troubleshooting documentation. This project represents my full XR pipeline experience — from Blender rigging to Unity prefab management to A-Frame WebXR interactions.

💻 C and C++ Coursework

Low-level programming including pointers, structs, memory management, file I/O, and linked lists. This work strengthens my foundation for simulation software, embedded systems, and performance-aware coding.

📊 MATLAB Coursework

Numerical methods, signal processing, data visualization, and algorithmic logic relevant to robotics, modeling, and simulation behavior analysis.

🐍 Python & SQL Projects

Data parsing, timeline visualization, text processing, SQL normalization, relational schema design, and JSON exports. Demonstrates skills in backend logic, data structures, and workflow automation.

More projects coming as I continue building toward simulation development roles.
