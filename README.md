# 👩🏽‍🔬 forged-by-sim

**Crafting immersive, science-rooted simulations with code, curiosity, and a growth-like mindset.**

Hi, I’m Noemi — a biomedical scientist turned simulation technologist, exploring the frontiers of XR, aerospace, and health-tech. My mission is to build high-impact simulation tools that empower training, deepen learning, and spark discovery.

---

## 🔧 Currently Exploring
- 🧠 Extended Reality (XR) for training & simulation
- 🧪 MATLAB + Python for scientific computing
- 💻 Git & GitHub workflows for portfolio-building
- ✨ Simulation storytelling & spatial learning
- 🔍 Human-centered design for high-stakes scenarios

---

## 🧰 Tech & Tools
`Python` `Unity` `MATLAB` `C++` `GitHub`  
`Jupyter Notebooks` `Arduino` `Laerdal SimMan` `Gaumard HAL`  
`Adobe Illustrator` `Coursera XR for Everybody` `Linux CLI`

## 📚 Philosophical Books Recommended
> *"We are simulators by nature — testing outcomes, replaying steps, dreaming realities before they manifest."*  
> Philosophy and Simulation: The Emergence of Synthetic Reason by Manuel DeLanda  
> Reality + : Virtual Worlds and the Problems of Philosophy by David J. Chalmers  
> Calculated Surprises: A Philosophy of Computer Simulation  

Personal favorites (not in any particular order):

> BLAME! by Tsutomu Nihei

Everything here is **forged by sim** — built with intention, experimentation, and a lot of determination to learn.
