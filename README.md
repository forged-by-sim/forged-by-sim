# 🧪 forged-by-sim

🌱 **Crafting immersive, science-rooted simulations with code, curiosity, and a growth-driven mindset.**

Welcome! I bring 7 years of experience in medical simulation operations, where I worked hands-on with high-fidelity manikins (Laerdal, Gaumard, Big Red), ran classroom simulations, trained learners, and troubleshot complex hardware/software in high-pressure environments.

With a background in biological and biomedical sciences, I’ve pivoted toward technical simulation development — blending my domain expertise with programming, XR development, and systems design.

Full XR workflow — from Blender rigging and Unity prefab management to WebXR deployment and scene troubleshooting. Includes detailed documentation on pipeline challenges and solutions across platforms.

### 💾 C / C++ Systems Programming
Low-level logic using pointers, structs, memory management, file I/O, and linked lists. Reinforces simulation logic, embedded systems thinking, and performance-sensitive scripting.

### 📈 MATLAB for Simulation Logic
Explored numerical methods, signal processing, visualization, and algorithmic design for behavior modeling in simulation environments.

### 🐍 Python & 🐘 SQL Projects
Data parsing, timeline graphs, text cleaning, schema design, workflow automation, and JSON exporting. Projects focused on backend simulation logic and information pipelines.

### 📊 R Programming & Simulation Pipelines
Hands-on work with data wrangling, closures, object-oriented S3/S4 design, and reproducible research. Applied R to build modular analytics workflows for simulation prototyping.
